=============

I have completed the tournaments project at the end of 'Intro to Relational Databases' course.

The project included

 - Swiss Style matching system in which all the players get to play till the end
 - Ranking the players based on the matched they have won
 - Mathcing players of similar ranks to play against each other
 - The one who ends up on top at the end of the ln(n) rounds where n is the number of players is the winner.
